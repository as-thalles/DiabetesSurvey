# DiabetesSurvey
Group assignment for my postgraduate Data Science course, more specifically the Predictive Models subject.

In this work we simply run a few classification algorithms in a dataset to diagnose diabetes based on a few characteristics.

We'd previously considered running both cross-validated and hold-out trainings but we decided to stick with the latter for simplicity's sake.  Got decent results averaging at about 75% accuracy on SVM and 55% on Decision Trees. All in all this was just a simple assignment to demonstrate the usage of predictive models and the results obtained are as described at the end of the notebook (albeit in portuguese).
